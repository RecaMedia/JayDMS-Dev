## Want to Contribute?

First read our [contributing](https://github.com/RecaMedia/JayDMS-Dev/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) readme file prior to starting. With that said, keep in mind all development files live under the `/development` folder. The `/project` folder serves as an example _root directory_ for local development to test JayDMS. Make sure you have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Gulp JS](https://gulpjs.com/), and Apache/PHP (suggested for [Mac](https://www.mamp.info/en/) or [Windows](http://www.wampserver.com/en/download-wampserver-64bits/)) installed locally. If you have prepared your local environment, begin by following the steps below.

**Navigate to development folder**
```sh
$ cd /development
```
**Install all dependencies**
```sh
$ npm install
```

JayDMS development uses `http://jdms-dev.local` URL for local testing. Modify your host file to include the following.

**Add URL to host file**

`127.0.0.1	jdms-dev.local`

**Mac**

`/private/etc/hosts`

**Windows**

`\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

Next, you'll have to modify your vhost file to redirect the dev URL to the appropriate folder.

```sh
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName jdms-dev.local
	DocumentRoot c:/path/to/your/repo/directory/project
	<Directory  "c:/path/to/your/repo/directory/project/">
		AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

At this point, you can start running your Apache/PHP environment. Within the `/development` folder, start your development server.

**Start local server**
```sh
$ npm start
```

To finalize files for release, use the following command.

**Minify for release**
```sh
$ npm run deploy
```
